About Me - Thaimu Turay
Hello! My name is Thaimu Turay, and I am a passionate and dedicated individual from Tombo, Sierra Leone. I have a diverse range of interests and skills that allow me to make an impact in several areas, including blogging, business, technology, and community development.

I am the founder of Countri Bloggers, a platform where I share news, entertainment, social experiments, and political analysis, both from home and abroad. As a political analysis blogger, I focus on providing insights into the political landscape in Sierra Leone and beyond, with a particular interest in the APC party.

I am currently studying Business Information Technology (BIT) at the University of Management and Technology (UNIMTECH). My career includes various roles in communication, advocacy, and marketing, and I have also worked as a Typist at Junior and Daughters Printing Press. Additionally, I have a wealth of experience in sales, IT, and customer service.

In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a deep commitment to social causes. I am working on a project called the Old Age Home in Bailor Community, Tombo, aimed at supporting the elderly. I am also planning to launch an e-commerce platform for local foods and products in Sierra Leone. As a film director and comedian, Iâ€™m exploring new ways to entertain and educate my audience.

Outside of my professional life, I enjoy staying connected with my community and have an ongoing interest in the development of Sierra Leone, particularly in areas like technology, youth empowerment, and political change. Through my blog and projects, I hope to contribute to creating a brighter future for my country.
